# 3D Graphics in the Browser with Elm

Source code for the post "3D Graphics in the Browser with Elm"

You can update the post just editing some of the file in the `src/Assets` folder and sending a Pull Requests.

To preview the result, you need to clone this repo, run `elm reactor` and hit http://localhost:8000/src/Main.elm, but you don't need to do so for small updates.

I will be doing and update the post, once the Pull Requests are merged.

If you don't understand how to do this, simply open an issue, describing what you would like to modify.

Thanks!
